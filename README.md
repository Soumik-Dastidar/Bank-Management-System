Bank Management System: Pubali Bank Limited

This is my first-year project titled Bank Management System: Pubali Bank Limited.
The project is built entirely in C programming language using only File I/O â€” no external database or library is used.

You are free to copy this code and customize it according to your needs.
Iâ€™ve added comments in every major part (with the help of ChatGPT) so that even beginners can understand the logic easily.

If you find any bugs while running it, please leave a comment in my GitHub repo.
Thank you. ðŸ™‚ Happy Coding!
